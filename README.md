## Multidirectional Antenna Pointing Systen

This project consists of using three linear actuators to control the orientation of a patch antenna. This way, the antenna can be kept pointed towards the balloon at any given time, which should improve the reliability of the radio communication systems. It will be controlled with a Raspberry Pi unit.
