## Mechanically Oriented Radio Antenna

This is a patch antenna (directional antenna) for use on top of the van, automatically orienting itself towards the balloon using a Raspberry Pi controlling three linear actuators anchored to its underside in a triangle formation.

Orienting the antenna towards the balloon at all times ensures much better connectivity and communication with the payloads than before.
